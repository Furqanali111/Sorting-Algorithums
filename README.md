# Sorting-Algorithums
In this project we are going to compare the time taken buy different sorting algoritum for a specific array.
# Algoritum included are:
1)Bubble Sort.                      
2)Insertion Sort.                       
3)Merge Sort.                    
4)Selection Sort.                   
# Array used for testing:
[12, 11, 13, 5, 6,40,60,23,1232,1,32323,4,6543,0]
